Experience
==========

The following briefly summarizes both my academic and
industry experience along with selected achievements.

Academic experience
-------------------

I received BSc *cum laude* and MSc *cum laude* degrees in applied physics
from `University of Tartu (Estonia)
<http://www.ut.ee/>`_ in 2005 and 2008, respectively.
During the undrgraduate study I worked on designing and
building electroncis and writing low level software for an
underwater robot (project of
my former colleague Madis Listak). The results are published in
various peer-reviewed international journals 
and proceedings (see :ref:`publications`).

In 2006 I shifted my research focus on more fundamental science --
I started developing a physics based model of ionic
polymer-metal composite (IPMC) actuators and sensors in professor
`Aabloo's group <http://www.ims.ut.ee>`_ at 
`University of Tartu <http://www.ut.ee>`_.

In the same year I visited professor 
`Kwang J. Kim laboratory <http://www.kwangjinkim.org>`_
at `University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) <http://www.unr.edu>`_
as a research scholar for two semesters. 
In 2008 I defended MSc *cum laude* at University of Tartu
mainly based on the research carried out at UNR. 

Thereafter I continued my studies and research
as a Ph.D. student  
in professor Kim's work group at UNR. I have also been collaborating
with professor `Pavel Solin <http://hpfem.org/~pavel/>`_ since 2010 in 
implementing the fundamental IPMC equations in $hp$-FEM solver
`Hermes <http://www.hpfem.org/hermes/>`_.

Overall, my academic work has resulted in :ref:`7 journal articles <journal>`  
and over :ref:`15 conference proceedings <conference>`. The total number
of academic publications with my involvement is shown below:


Work experience
---------------

I have been with `Cybernetica AS <http://www.cyber.ee/home/index.html>`_ 
since Spring 2005; I started as a software developer
and progressed to software engineer and project manager by 2008.
I have worked over 6 years on designing and programming 
various enterprise level information systems (J2EE).
Additionally, I have been part of a 
number of different projects that have involved
technologies such as Oracle Service Bus (OSB), Weblogic, PL/SQL, and 
various programming languages. 
For instance, one project was to implement 
from scratch both parser and compiler for a 
programming language Waebric using `Simpl
<http://research.cyber.ee/simpl/>`_ and `Scala <http://www.scala-lang.org/>`_.

.. seealso::

	`Waebric source code <https://github.com/simpl-dev/waebric>`_	

From 2004 to 2005 I worked for `H. Eller School <http://www.tmk.ee/>`_ as
a system administrator. My duties included administrating 
two linux based servers, a Windows 2003 server (Active Directory, IIS, etc),
and at least 20 PCs.
